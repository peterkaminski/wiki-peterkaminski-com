## Stop Tracking A File

Source:

Remove the file from the index:

```shell
git rm --cached <file>
```

Remove a whole directory:

```
git rm -r --cached <folder>
```

WARNING: While this will not remove the physical file from your local machines, it will remove the files from other developers machines on next `git pull`.
